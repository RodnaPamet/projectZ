/**
 * The ring-and-arc spinner.
 *
 * ── THE TWO CLASSES ARE DOING TWO DIFFERENT JOBS ──────────────────
 *
 * The first `<path>` is the full ring and paints with `fill="currentColor"`,
 * i.e. the `text-*` class. The second is the leading arc and paints with
 * `fill="currentFill"` — not a real CSS keyword, so the presentation
 * attribute is discarded and the arc inherits `fill` from the `<svg>`,
 * i.e. the `fill-*` class. So: `text-*` is the TRACK, `fill-*` is the
 * INDICATOR. (The spelling is inherited from the upstream this was
 * ported from; it works, but only by that route.)
 *
 * Those were `fill-neutral-600 text-neutral-200` — a raw palette, which
 * means a fixed lightness in a themed product. On the dark theme the
 * track came out near-white and the indicator came out darker than the
 * ring it travels on, so the arc read as a notch cut out of a bright
 * circle rather than as progress; on light the track all but vanished.
 * The semantic tokens make the relationship hold in both themes: a
 * subtle boundary tone for the track it is drawn ON, a legible content
 * tone for the mark the eye is meant to follow.
