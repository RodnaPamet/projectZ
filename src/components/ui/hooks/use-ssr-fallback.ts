/**
 * May the server-rendered rows be used as SWR `fallbackData`?
 *
 * A list page is server-rendered for one specific filter combination. The
 * client then owns the filters, so the SSR payload is only a valid seed
 * while the active filters still describe the same query. Diverge, and
 * `fallbackData` would show the server's rows for filters the user has
 * since changed — stale content that looks authoritative, with no spinner
 * to suggest otherwise.
 *
 * The rule, in the two cases that matter:
 *
 *   - The server rendered WITHOUT filters (`serverHadFilters` false): the
 *     payload is the unfiltered list, so it is a valid seed exactly while
 *     the client has no active filters either.
 *   - The server rendered WITH filters: every key present on either side
 *     must match. Comparing only the client's keys would let a filter the
 *     server applied — and the client has since cleared — pass unnoticed,
 *     which is why the key set is the union rather than one side's.
 *
 * Missing and empty-string are treated as the same thing (`?? ''`), because
 * a cleared filter reaches here as `''` from the URL but is simply absent
 * from the server's object.
 *
 * This ran as six copies, one per list page, identical apart from
 * formatting and a couple of non-null assertions. Getting it subtly wrong
 * in one file would produce stale rows on one page only, which is close to
 * the hardest kind of bug to notice.
