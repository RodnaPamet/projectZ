/**
 * `useToast()` — Roadmap-2 PR-9.
 *
 * One canonical toast vocabulary across the product. Four named
 * methods, each with a locked variant + duration + dismiss
 * behaviour. Pages don't reach for sonner's raw `toast()` —
 * they call the right method on this hook and the design
 * decisions stay centralized.
 *
 *   useToast().success('Item created')
 *   useToast().error('Save failed', { description: '…' })
 *   useToast().info('Settings updated')
 *   useToast().warning('This action cannot be undone')
 *
 * Why a hook (not a free function):
 *   • Future versions can layer in route-context (auto-dismiss
 *     on navigation, suppression during print mode) without
 *     touching call sites.
 *   • The hook is the canonical seam for ratchets — banning
 *     direct `from 'sonner'` imports forces every call site
 *     through one place.
 *
 * The undo pattern (`useToastWithUndo`) is the FIFTH method.
 * It lives in its own file because the timing + countdown bar
 * mechanics are different enough to deserve a dedicated hook.
 * `useToast` and `useToastWithUndo` coexist; this hook never
 * tries to absorb the undo flow.
 *
 * Locked durations:
 *   • success — 3000ms (short, the user moves on)
 *   • info    — 4000ms (slightly longer to read)
 *   • warning — 5000ms (caution, ensure attention)
 *   • error   — Infinity (sticky-with-dismiss; the user must
 *               acknowledge)
 *
 * Override locked durations via `opts.duration` only when
 * genuinely needed (long-running uploads etc.). Default is the
 * locked value.

    // `toastOptions` set the default per variant. It does not:
    // `providers.tsx` mounts `<Toaster … duration={3000} />` and has
    // no `toastOptions` at all. So three of the four documented
    // durations above were fiction for the common call — the
    // single-argument one — and the consequential one was `error`,
    // documented as sticky-until-dismiss (`Infinity`) and actually
    // auto-dismissing after three seconds. A failure the user has
    // not acknowledged disappearing on its own is the exact thing
    // `Infinity` was chosen to prevent.
    //
    // Forwarding unconditionally also makes the locked table the
    // single source of truth, rather than something a flat number at
    // the mount silently overrides.

    // An explicit `opts.duration` still wins — that is the
    // documented override, and `??` keeps a caller-supplied
    // `Infinity` or `0` intact where `||` would not.
