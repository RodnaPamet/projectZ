/**
 * STILL SURFACE — the motionless button material.
 *
 * Supersedes the whole R19 → R24 stack (carbon grain, aura wash,
 * iridescent meniscus, liquid glass). Those recipes built depth out of
 * MOTION: a hover fade on `::before`, an aura bloom on `::after`, a
 * press that shrank 3% and travelled 1px down. Still Surface builds the
 * same depth out of static light, and moves the hover signal out of
 * motion and into HUE.
 *
 * The thesis: hover is a TRADE OF EDGES. The brand tile takes the
 * complementary edge; the surface tile takes the brand edge. Each
 * variant borrows the other's colour, and neither one moves to do it.
 *
 * The complementary hue was already in the system —
 * `--brand-secondary-default` is documented in tokens.css as the
 * brand's complement. THAT IS A REQUIREMENT ON THE TOKEN, not a
 * description of one palette: this material's hover language is a trade
 * of edges, so `--brand-secondary-default` MUST be the complementary
 * hue of `--brand-default` in EVERY theme the product ships. Give it
 * some unrelated accent and hover stops reading as a trade and starts
 * reading as a mistake. Nothing was invented here; it is the existing
 * palette, held still.
 *
 * Four static layers carry the depth, none of them a keyframe:
 *   1. edge light   — a highlight along the top ~46% (`--btn-still-top`)
 *   2. body gradient— brand → brand-emphasis vertical fall
 *   3. seat line    — `inset 0 -1px 0 var(--btn-still-bot)`
 *   4. lift → inset — `--btn-still-lift` inverts to `--btn-still-press`
 *
 * WHY MOTIONLESS. Feedback is not the same thing as animation. Every
 * state here switches instantly, which means the states can also be
 * DOCUMENTED side by side as static swatches — and there is nothing
 * left for `prefers-reduced-motion` to strip, because there was never
 * anything moving to begin with.
 *
 * Deliberately removed (do not reintroduce — the ratchets below fail):
 *   `transition-all duration-150`   base transition
 *   `active:scale-[0.97]`           press shrink
 *   `active:translate-y-px`         press travel
 *   `before:transition-opacity`     hover fade
 *   `hover:after:shadow-*`          aura bloom
 *   `backdrop-blur-*`               unnecessary once the fill is graded
 */

/**
 * The shared solid-tile recipe: edge light over a body gradient, a
 * seat line, and a rest lift that inverts on press.
 *
 * Colour-agnostic — callers pass the two gradient stops, so primary
 * and destructive share one material and differ only in hue. That is
 * the point: a destructive button must read as the SAME physical
 * object as a primary one, or "dangerous" gets confused with
 * "different kind of control".
