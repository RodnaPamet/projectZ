/**
 * STILL SURFACE — the motionless button material.
 *
 * Supersedes the whole R19 → R24 stack (carbon grain, aura wash,
 * iridescent meniscus, liquid glass). Those recipes built depth out of
 * MOTION: a hover fade on `::before`, an aura bloom on `::after`, a
 * press that shrank 3% and travelled 1px down. Still Surface builds the
 * same depth out of static light, and moves the hover signal out of
 * motion and into HUE.
 *
 * The thesis: hover is a TRADE OF EDGES. The brand tile takes the
 * complementary edge; the surface tile takes the brand edge. Each
 * variant borrows the other's colour, and neither one moves to do it.
 *
 * The complementary hue was already in the system —
 * `--brand-secondary-default` is documented in tokens.css as the
 * brand's complement. THAT IS A REQUIREMENT ON THE TOKEN, not a
 * description of one palette: this material's hover language is a trade
 * of edges, so `--brand-secondary-default` MUST be the complementary
 * hue of `--brand-default` in EVERY theme the product ships. Give it
 * some unrelated accent and hover stops reading as a trade and starts
 * reading as a mistake. Nothing was invented here; it is the existing
 * palette, held still.
 *
 * Four static layers carry the depth, none of them a keyframe:
 *   1. edge light   — a highlight along the top ~46% (`--btn-still-top`)
 *   2. body gradient— brand → brand-emphasis vertical fall
 *   3. seat line    — `inset 0 -1px 0 var(--btn-still-bot)`
 *   4. lift → inset — `--btn-still-lift` inverts to `--btn-still-press`
 *
 * WHY MOTIONLESS. Feedback is not the same thing as animation. Every
 * state here switches instantly, which means the states can also be
 * DOCUMENTED side by side as static swatches — and there is nothing
 * left for `prefers-reduced-motion` to strip, because there was never
 * anything moving to begin with.
 *
 * Deliberately removed (do not reintroduce — the ratchets below fail):
 *   `transition-all duration-150`   base transition
 *   `active:scale-[0.97]`           press shrink
 *   `active:translate-y-px`         press travel
 *   `before:transition-opacity`     hover fade
 *   `hover:after:shadow-*`          aura bloom
 *   `backdrop-blur-*`               unnecessary once the fill is graded
 */

/**
 * THE SHARED SOLID-TILE RECIPE — eight classes, written out per variant.
 *
 * Edge light over a body gradient, a seat line, and a rest lift that
 * inverts on press. Primary and destructive wear the SAME material and
 * differ only in hue — a destructive button must read as the same
 * physical object as a primary one, or "dangerous" gets confused with
 * "different kind of control". The four hue slots, in the order the
 * classes appear below:
 *
 *   base  solid background-color (see A11Y below)
 *   from  rest gradient head        to  rest gradient tail + rest edge
 *   lift  hover brighten
 *
 * WHY THE EIGHT ARE SPELLED OUT RATHER THAN GENERATED (#3084). This was
 * `stillTile(from, to, lift, base)`, which returned them as template
 * literals — `bg-[${base}]`, `border-[${to}]`, the two `bg-[image:…]`
 * gradients, the `active:` flat gradient. Tailwind finds classes by
 * SCANNING SOURCE TEXT and never evaluates a function, so
 * `bg-[var(--btn-still-danger)]` was a string that existed nowhere in the
 * tree. Measured on a real CSS build of this entry point: ELEVEN of the
 * tile's fourteen classes had no rule in the output at all. Destructive
 * therefore painted no fill — a white label on the white UA background in
 * the light theme — and primary looked roughly right only because
 * `bg-[var(--brand-emphasis)]` happens to be written literally in ten
 * other components.
 *
 * So the literal strings ARE the contract, and the duplication is the
 * price of it: a class Tailwind cannot see does not exist. Do not DRY
 * these back into a helper, an interpolation or a `cn()` of fragments,
 * and do not reach for a `tailwind.config.js` safelist — that is a second
 * list, kept in sync by hand, that drifts. `still-surface-button-material`
 * evaluates `buttonVariants()` for every variant and fails if any class it
 * returns is not written literally in a file Tailwind scans.
 *
 * A11Y — WHY `base` EXISTS AT ALL. A tile painted only with
 * `background-image` has no colour for a contrast checker to resolve, so
 * axe walks up to the nearest ancestor with a real `background-color` —
 * the page — and measures the label against THAT. On primary that meant
 * navy-on-navy (~1:1) and a serious colour-contrast violation on every
 * page, even though the label against the actual gradient is ~9.6:1. Each
 * variant's `base` is deliberately the WORST-CASE stop for its own text
 * colour, so a checker measures the true floor rather than a flattering
 * midpoint: the DEEP stop where the label is dark (primary — dark ink
 * needs a light field) and the LIGHTEST stop where the label is white
 * (destructive — white needs a dark field).
 *
 * HOVER brightens the gradient by shifting BOTH stops one rung up the
 * ramp: the tile gets lighter without losing its fall, where a flat brand
 * fill would read as the gradient collapsing. The hover base tracks the
 * hover gradient for the same reason.
 *
 * PRESS inverts the lift to an inset and flattens the gradient to the deep
 * stop. Pressed reads as pressed with nothing travelling — the shadow does
 * the work the transform used to.
