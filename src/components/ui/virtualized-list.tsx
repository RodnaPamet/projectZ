/**
 * Epic 68 — `<VirtualizedList>` primitive.
 *
 * Reusable foundation for windowed rendering across the app. Wraps
 * `react-window` behind an ergonomic, react-window-agnostic API so
 * consumers (DataTable bodies, Combobox dropdowns, CardList grids,
 * future surfaces) never import react-window directly. If we replace
 * react-window with a different windowing engine later, the swap
 * happens in one file — and this migration is the proof that the
 * indirection earns its keep: react-window 2.x deleted every symbol
 * the old implementation imported, and only this file changed shape.
 *
 * Contract — only THREE props are required:
 *   - `itemCount`     — total number of logical items
 *   - `itemSize`      — fixed pixel height OR `(index) => height` for
 *                       variable rows
 *   - `renderItem`    — `({ index, style }) => ReactNode`. The `style`
 *                       MUST be applied to the rendered row's outer
 *                       element so react-window can absolute-position
 *                       it inside the scroll viewport.
 *
 * ═══ SIZING, AND WHY AutoSizer IS GONE ═══
 *
 * v1 could not size itself: `FixedSizeList` demanded literal `height`
 * and `width` numbers, so this file carried a four-branch AutoSizer
 * matrix to measure whichever dimension the caller had not supplied.
 *
 * v2's `List` IS the scroll container and sizes itself — its root
 * carries `maxHeight: 100%; flex-grow: 1; overflow-y: auto` and it
 * observes its own box. So:
 *
 *   - `height` given   → forwarded as `style.height`. react-window
 *                        reads a numeric style height DIRECTLY and
 *                        skips the ResizeObserver entirely, which is
 *                        what makes this deterministic under jsdom.
 *   - `height` omitted → the list fills its parent. The parent MUST
 *                        have a determinate size (flex-1, fixed
 *                        height, or position constraints) or the list
 *                        collapses to 0px, exactly as before.
 *
 * `react-virtualized-auto-sizer` is no longer a dependency of this
 * primitive, or of the app.
 *
 * What this is NOT — a 2D grid virtualizer (use react-window's `Grid`
 * for those rare cases) and not a way to defer rendering items by
 * index range (it's a viewport-driven window, not a paginator).
 * Card-list rollouts that want to virtualize a 3-column responsive
 * grid group cards into rows-of-N before passing to this primitive.
