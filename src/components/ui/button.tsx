/**
 * The geometry + touch floor the two `cn`-only branches below share with
 * `buttonVariants`.
 *
 * Both branches bypass the cva variant — they are fallbacks for shapes
 * that are not interactive buttons — so anything the cva base carries
 * has to be restated here or it is silently dropped. Two things were:
 *
 *   `pointer-coarse:min-h-11` — the WCAG 2.5.5 / Apple HIG 44px touch
 *     floor. Without it a button that is 44px tall on a phone collapses
 *     to its 28px desktop height the instant `loading` goes true — i.e.
 *     exactly while the user is most likely to tap it again. `min-h`
 *     only RAISES, so fine pointers keep the 28px density.
 *
 *   `relative` + HIT_AREA_CLASS — the square hit area (see
 *     `hit-area.ts`). The `relative` is load-bearing: without a
 *     positioning context the pseudo-element's offsets resolve against
 *     an ancestor and the hit area detaches. It paints nothing.
 *
 *     Honest about what this buys on each branch: on the `loading`
 *     branch the element carries the real `disabled` attribute, so it
 *     answers no pointer events at all and the dead corners are moot —
 *     the layer is here so the two `cn` fallbacks and the cva base stay
 *     the SAME shape and cannot drift apart silently. On the
 *     `disabledTooltip` branch it is live work: that element is
 *     focusable and hoverable, and its corners really were inert.
 *
 * The 28px rung itself stays spelled out at each branch, where the
 * mirror-the-size-scale comment explains it.

           * The wrapper used to be a plain `<div>`, which is not in the
           * tab order, so the one thing this branch exists to say — WHY
           * the control is unavailable — was reachable by hover only.
           * A keyboard or screen-reader user met a dead shape with no
           * reason attached.
           *
           * Three parts, and each does something the others do not:
           *
           *   `role="button"` + `aria-disabled` — announces it as the
           *     control it looks like, in the state it is in. A real
           *     `disabled` attribute is not an option: `disabled`
           *     removes the element from the tab order, which is the
           *     problem rather than the fix.
           *   `tabIndex={0}` — puts it IN the tab order, which is what
           *     makes the tooltip openable at all (Radix opens on
           *     `:focus-visible`, i.e. keyboard focus).
           *   `aria-describedby` → the `sr-only` span — the reason is
           *     announced on focus WITHOUT waiting for the tooltip to
           *     open, so it does not depend on the tooltip's timing or
           *     on the portal being read.
           *
           * `aria-labelledby` → the LABEL div is the fourth part, and it
           * is not decoration. Radix's Trigger needs a single child, so
           * the description has to live INSIDE this element — and the
           * accessible name of a `role="button"` is computed from its
           * contents, which would fold the reason into the name and
           * announce it twice ("Sync now, Connect a directory first.
           * Connect a directory first."). Naming the label explicitly
           * confines the name to the label. When there is no label at
           * all the attribute is omitted, so the contents algorithm
           * still applies rather than resolving to an empty name.
           *
           * No `onClick` / `onKeyDown`: focusing it must explain, never
           * activate. That is the whole difference from `buttonLikeKeys`.
