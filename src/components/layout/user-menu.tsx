/**
 * Roadmap-14 PR-5 — `<UserMenu>` — right-slot avatar + dropdown.
 *
 * Mounts to the right of every workspace-aware top-bar surface
 * (tenant or org variant). Provides the canonical home for
 * account-scoped verbs:
 *
 *   • Theme toggle (light / dark)
 *   • Sign out
 *
 * Future PRs may extend with Profile, Account settings, Keyboard
 * shortcuts (already exists, triggered by `?` key). PR-5 keeps the
 * menu intentionally small — adding items the user can't reach via
 * a real route would be misleading.
 *
 * The avatar trigger replaces the sidebar's "log-out icon at the
 * bottom" affordance as the global account-actions home; the
 * sidebar's existing identity panel + log-out icon stay in place
 * until R14-PR12 mobile unification, when they're consolidated
 * here.
 *
 * Data: `useSession()` for the display name. Falls back to
 * "Account" when name is unset (legitimate state for unauth-during-
 * hydration; the menu itself never renders unauthed because
 * `<AppShell>` doesn't mount).
 *
 * Visual: 32×32 round avatar with the user's initials over a
 * brand-subtle fill. Hover brightens (motion-language safe). The
 * dropdown opens to `align="end"` so it hugs the right edge of the
 * viewport and never overflows.

  /**
   * The element that opens the menu. Omit it — as every call site in this
   * repo does — and the menu renders its own avatar button, unchanged.
   *
   * WHY AN ELEMENT RATHER THAN A RENDER PROP, because `items` above is a
   * render prop and two idioms in one file would need excusing. The rule
   * `items` states is the deciding one: a render prop exists when the
   * consumer needs state only the menu owns. `items` needs `close`. A
   * trigger needs nothing — `<Popover>` hands its children to an `asChild`
   * Trigger, whose Slot merges the open handler, `aria-expanded`,
   * `aria-controls` and `data-state` onto whatever element arrives. The
   * consumer reads `open` off `data-state` in CSS and never sees the menu's
   * state at all, so a render prop would be a callback with nothing to pass.
   *
   * FOCUS RETURNS BY ITSELF, and that is the point of routing the caller's
   * element through the Trigger rather than accepting a click handler. Radix
   * returns focus to its Trigger on close; because the caller's element IS
   * the Trigger, that is the caller's element. `MobileNavDrawer` needed an
   * explicit `openerRef` in T07 for exactly the opposite reason — its opener
   * is the top bar's hamburger, which is NOT its Trigger, so Radix had
   * nothing to focus and the drawer had to capture the opener by hand. A
   * trigger slot has no such gap, so it gets no such machinery.
   *
   * TYPED `ReactElement`, not `ReactNode`: the Slot contract is exactly one
   * element that accepts props and a ref (`form-field.tsx` types its cloned
   * child the same way). A string or an array breaks it at runtime, so the
   * type refuses them. A fragment still typechecks and still breaks — that
   * one is unreachable from the type system.
   *
   * TWO THINGS THE CALLER OWNS, neither inheritable from here:
   *
   *   • The accessible name. The default avatar carries
   *     `aria-label={tNav('accountMenuFor', { name })}` because an avatar is
   *     a picture with no text. A caller's trigger is named by its own label
   *     and must stay so — this component cannot name someone else's button.
   *   • WCAG 2.5.5. `AVATAR_BUTTON_CLASS` carries the
   *     `pointer-coarse:min-h-11` floor T08 added, and a supplied trigger
   *     does not go through it. Nothing here can check that: the element is
   *     constructed in the consumer's tree, and jsdom has no layout, so even
   *     the consumer's own guard has to assert the RECIPE the way
   *     `top-bar-touch-and-slots` does rather than a measured box. The floor
   *     is the caller's to carry and the caller's to guard.
   *
   * `<Popover>`'s Trigger also contributes a display utility to the merged
   * class list — `sm:inline-flex` on the dropdown path, `sm:hidden` on the
   * drawer path — which the avatar has always received too. A trigger whose
   * own layout is a `display` utility should expect that one to win inside
   * the breakpoint, where media-query order beats string order.

// carry.
const AVATAR_BUTTON_CLASS =

  // avatar but did not answer to `:hover`. See `hit-area.ts`. That fixes
  // the DEAD ZONE inside the box; it does not change the box, so the
  // control was still 22x22 against WCAG 2.5.5's 44. T08 (#3003) adds the
  // `pointer-coarse:` floor — the same shortfall as the hamburger, in the
  // same bar, and the two are fixed together rather than one looking odd
  // beside its unchanged neighbour.
