/**
 * Roadmap-14 PR-5 — `<UserMenu>` — right-slot avatar + dropdown.
 *
 * Mounts to the right of every workspace-aware top-bar surface
 * (tenant or org variant). Provides the canonical home for
 * account-scoped verbs:
 *
 *   • Theme toggle (light / dark)
 *   • Sign out
 *
 * Future PRs may extend with Profile, Account settings, Keyboard
 * shortcuts (already exists, triggered by `?` key). PR-5 keeps the
 * menu intentionally small — adding items the user can't reach via
 * a real route would be misleading.
 *
 * The avatar trigger replaces the sidebar's "log-out icon at the
 * bottom" affordance as the global account-actions home; the
 * sidebar's existing identity panel + log-out icon stay in place
 * until R14-PR12 mobile unification, when they're consolidated
 * here.
 *
 * Data: `useSession()` for the display name. Falls back to
 * "Account" when name is unset (legitimate state for unauth-during-
 * hydration; the menu itself never renders unauthed because
 * `<AppShell>` doesn't mount).
 *
 * Visual: 32×32 round avatar with the user's initials over a
 * brand-subtle fill. Hover brightens (motion-language safe). The
 * dropdown opens to `align="end"` so it hugs the right edge of the
 * viewport and never overflows.

// carry.

  // `HIT_AREA_CLASS`: 14% of this 22px avatar circle's box rendered as
  // avatar but did not answer to `:hover`. See `hit-area.ts`. That fixes
  // the DEAD ZONE inside the box; it does not change the box, so the
  // control was still 22x22 against WCAG 2.5.5's 44. T08 (#3003) adds the
  // `pointer-coarse:` floor — the same shortfall as the hamburger, in the
  // same bar, and the two are fixed together rather than one looking odd
  // beside its unchanged neighbour.
