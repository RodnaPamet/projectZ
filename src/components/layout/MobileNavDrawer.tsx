/**
 * The phone navigation drawer, on the shared left Sheet.
 *
 * T07 of #3003, and an owner-approved behaviour change. What stood here
 * was a hand-rolled drawer: its own backdrop, its own panel, its own
 * `inert` bookkeeping — a second overlay implementation living beside
 * the Sheet primitive and drifting from it. T03 added
 * `direction="left"` to Sheet for exactly this, so the drawer now slides
 * in from the edge the nav rail occupies rather than arriving from the
 * opposite side.
 *
 * THE CONVERSION IS NOT A DROP-IN, and most of this file is the reason.
 * The hand-rolled version had earned four behaviours; a bare
 * `<Sheet direction="left">` keeps one of them. Each of the other three
 * is reinstated here deliberately:
 *
 *   ESCAPE stays on the shared shortcut system. Vaul closes on Escape by
 *     itself, which would have been the easy answer and the wrong one:
 *     its handler is unconditional, so it cannot respect precedence
 *     against the other Escape bindings that may be live (selection
 *     clear, filter clear), and a contributor grepping for shortcut
 *     sources would no longer find this one. So vaul's is suppressed via
 *     `onEscapeKeyDown` and the binding is registered at
 *     `scope: 'overlay'`, priority 5 — above selection clear (2) and
 *     filter clear (1), below any modal stacked over the drawer. The
 *     scope works unchanged because Sheet's own backdrop already carries
 *     the `data-sheet-overlay` marker the scope reads.
 *
 *   FOCUS RETURN is explicit, not inherited. A probe of a controlled
 *     Sheet (open from a button, Escape to close) left focus on neither
 *     the opener nor `<body>`, so the primitive cannot be relied on for
 *     it here. Note this is VAUL, not a Radix Dialog — the Radix
 *     `onCloseAutoFocus` mechanism that T03 fixed for Modal does not
 *     apply, and should not be assumed to. The opener is captured at
 *     open time and restored on close, guarded so focus is only reclaimed
 *     when the drawer is the thing that lost it.
 *
 *   ROUTE-CHANGE CLOSE moved UP to `AppShellFrame`, which owns the open
 *     state. It is not missing; it is one level out, where the state it
 *     mutates lives.
 *
 * The fourth — `inert` while closed — is the one Sheet genuinely
 * replaces: the panel is portalled and unmounted rather than parked
 * off-screen, so there is nothing closed to make inert.
