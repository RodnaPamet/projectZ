/**
 * Language switcher — segmented control for the UI locale.
 *
 * Mounted inside `<UserMenu>` beside the theme toggle. Selecting a locale
 * persists it to the `inflect_locale` cookie CLIENT-SIDE (mirroring
 * `ThemeProvider.persistTheme`), then calls `router.refresh()` so every server
 * component re-renders with the new next-intl catalog (the cookie is read
 * server-side in `src/i18n.ts`).
 *
 * Why a client-side cookie and not a Server Action: the cookie is not
 * HttpOnly, so `document.cookie` can write it directly. Using a Server Action
 * (the previous implementation) coupled the switch to a build-specific action
 * ID — after a deploy, an already-open tab held a stale ID and the POST failed
 * with `UnrecognizedActionError` (a 404 on the current route). Writing the
 * cookie in the browser has no such coupling and is immune to deploy skew.
 *
 * Options show the SHORT CODE ("EN" / "БГ") because the control sits in a
 * 240px popover row beside the theme toggle, where the full endonyms
 * ("English" / "Български") crowd it. The endonym is not dropped — it is
 * rendered `sr-only` so it remains the ACCESSIBLE NAME of each radio;
 * `<ToggleGroupOption>` has no per-option aria-label, and the accessible name
 * of a `role="radio"` is computed from its contents, so a bare short code
 * would otherwise leave screen readers announcing "EN".
 *
 * Both strings are interpolated from constants rather than written as literal
 * JSX text. A literal `>English<` text node would newly trip the i18n
 * adoption ratchet, which this file is (correctly) not baselined in.
 *
 * The group's own name is `common.language`, read in the viewer's locale:
 * the word `<UserMenu>` prints beside the switch. It was the literal
 * "Language", which a screen reader announced in English on a Bulgarian
 * page (#3201). A host that copies this file needs the key in each of its
 * catalogues.

   * A host that keeps the preference on the user record, and re-seeds the

   * at all: the switch flipped the page and the next request flipped it
