/**
 * #2222 — the single app-wide notice for a lapsed session.
 *
 * Mounted ONCE in `src/app/providers.tsx`, which is what dedupes it. The
 * alternative — each poller surfacing its own message — puts one notice per
 * poller on screen: a dense page whose rows and connectors each carry their
 * own badge reached ~38 at the time this was written, because every one of
 * them runs its own poll.
 *
 * The figure is kept and the component names are not. They were this
 * product's, and this file is copied verbatim by a downstream one — where
 * the names would be wrong and the count still true.
 *
 * It OFFERS a link to `/login`; it does not redirect. The writers into this
 * store are background pollers — `use-calendar-badge` refreshes every five
 * minutes from `SidebarNav` on every page — so an automatic redirect would
 * yank a user out of a half-finished upload with no way back to what they had
 * typed. Losing work to a nav counter is a worse bug than the one being
 * fixed.
 *
 * The read is `useSyncExternalStore`, not `useEffect` + `useState`: the store
 * is module-scoped precisely so an already-scheduled interval callback can
 * write to it, and that write can land before this component ever mounts.
