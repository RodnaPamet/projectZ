/**
 * #2222 — the single app-wide notice for a lapsed session.
 *
 * Mounted ONCE in `src/app/providers.tsx`, which is what dedupes it. The
 * alternative — each poller surfacing its own message — puts ~38 identical
 * notices on a process canvas with 20 edges and 15 linked nodes, because
 * every `ControlLinkBadge` / `RiskLinkBadge` / `AssetLinkBadge` and every
 * `ProcessEdge` runs its own poll.
 *
 * It OFFERS a link to `/login`; it does not redirect. The writers into this
 * store are background pollers — `use-calendar-badge` refreshes every five
 * minutes from `SidebarNav` on every page — so an automatic redirect would
 * yank a user out of a half-finished evidence upload with no way back to what
 * they had typed. Losing work to a nav counter is a worse bug than the one
 * being fixed.
 *
 * The read is `useSyncExternalStore`, not `useEffect` + `useState`: the store
 * is module-scoped precisely so an already-scheduled interval callback can
 * write to it, and that write can land before this component ever mounts.
