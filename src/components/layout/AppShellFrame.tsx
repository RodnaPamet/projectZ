/**
 * The app shell's FRAME — layout, drawer state, collapse state. No content.
 *
 * T07 of #3003. `AppShell` grew every decision the authenticated chrome
 * needs, and most of them belong to the host product rather than to the
 * frame: an auth import, two named sidebars, a top bar, a breadcrumbs
 * provider, a storage key spelled inline, and a route regex. A product
 * vendoring these files byte-identical had to carry a diff through all
 * of it.
 *
 * So the frame keeps only what is true of ANY sidebar-plus-top-bar app:
 *
 *   - the viewport-clamp layout chain (the part with real load-bearing
 *     CSS, carried over comment and all — it is the reason this file is
 *     worth extracting rather than reimplementing downstream);
 *   - whether the mobile drawer is open;
 *   - whether the desktop sidebar is collapsed, persisted;
 *   - closing the drawer when the route changes.
 *
 * Everything else arrives as a slot. The slots are render props, not
 * nodes, because each one needs state the frame owns: the sidebar needs
 * `collapsed` and its toggle, the drawer needs `open`/`onClose`, the top
 * bar needs the opener.
 *
 * WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, and why each would break reuse:
 *
 *   no auth — `signOut` is next-auth-specific. The consumer passes
 *     whatever its sidebar slot needs.
 *   no route literals — the full-bleed escape was a route regex baked
 *     into the shell. It is now a `fullBleed` boolean, so the caller
 *     decides from its own routing.
 *   no provider knowledge — a breadcrumbs provider must wrap the top bar
 *     AND the content, which sit in different places here. Hence
 *     `mainProvider`: a wrapper the frame applies around the whole main
 *     region, so a consumer can inject context without the frame naming
 *     it.
 *   no storage key — `collapseStorageKey` defaults through
 *     `uiStorageKey`, the T01 seam, so the namespace is the one constant
 *     a downstream product changes.
 *
 * Imported by MODULE PATH rather than the `ui/hooks` barrel. The barrel
 * is the house convention for in-repo consumers and its completeness is
 * guarded; a file written to be copied out takes the path so it arrives
 * with one import to satisfy rather than a barrel to recreate. See the
 * carve-out in `src/components/ui/hooks/index.ts`.

                several bars and giving each a no-print prop would be a
                wider change than the print rule needs.

                `contents`: the wrapper draws no box of its own. A sticky
                element sticks only within its parent, and this wrapper was
                exactly as tall as the top bar, so the NavBar's `sticky top-0`
                had no room to stick in and scrolled away with the page below
                md (#3216). Without a box the bar's parent is the main-region
                column, as tall as the page. Print still hides it: the print
                rule's `display: none` on `.no-print` replaces `contents`. */}

      {/* Inner content container.
                Mobile: padding + max-width + centering.
                Desktop: ALSO a flex column itself, so a child shell can
                claim flex-1 to fill height. Without `md:flex md:flex-col`
                here a child falls back to natural height and this div's
                overflow-y-auto scrolls instead of the child scrolling
                internally.

                The width cap climbs at 2xl and unblocks beyond, so a 4K
                screen does not leave the page in a narrow column;
                `mx-auto` keeps it centred at every step. `fullBleed`
                drops both for an edge-to-edge surface — padding stays. */}
      {/* THE `<main>` LANDMARK SITS HERE, not on the column that
                holds both this and the top bar (#3104).

                It used to wrap both, which put `NavBar`'s
                `<header role="banner">` INSIDE the main landmark — axe
                `landmark-banner-is-top-level`, measured moderate by projectZ
                T19 on a vendored copy of this frame, which had to suppress
                the rule to stay green. A screen reader's "jump to banner"
                then lands inside "jump to main".

                The two elements swapped names and NOT classes: every flex,
                overflow and min-h-0 class stayed on the element it was on,
                so the layout chain described above is byte-identical. What
                changed is which of them is the landmark — and this is the
                honest one, because `<main>` means the page's main content,
                which is exactly what this container holds. */}

  //   Mobile (<md): natural document scroll. `min-h-screen` on the
  //     wrapper, `overflow-x-clip` on the main-region column, no flex
  //     column.
  //   Desktop (md+): viewport-clamped flex chain. Wrapper is
  //     `h-full overflow-hidden`, the main-region column a flex column
  //     with `overflow-hidden`.
  //
  // `overflow-x-clip` below md, NOT `overflow-auto` (it was). Any overflow
  // other than `visible` or `clip` makes an element a scroll container, and
  // `position: sticky` sticks to the nearest scroll container. Below md
  // this column never scrolls (it grows with its content, and the document
  // scrolls), so everything sticky inside it scrolled away with the page:
  // a host page's sticky action bar, and with the top chrome's wrapper
  // (see `contents` there) the NavBar's `sticky top-0`. Measured in a host
  // (playerz, 393 px): the bar's `top` followed the scroll to -509 px.
  // `clip` still keeps wide content from pushing the page sideways, but
  // creates no scroll container, and it is the one non-visible value that
  // leaves `overflow-y: visible` as it is (any other turns `visible` on
  // the other axis into `auto`).
  //
  // "main-region column" rather than "<main>" since #3104: the element
  // carrying these classes is a plain <div>, and the `<main>` landmark is
  // the content container inside it. The classes did not move.
  //
  // Every flex parent carries `min-h-0` so children can shrink below
  // their content size — without it `flex-1` grows to content and the
  // chain breaks.
  //
  // `md:h-full` relies on the html/body height lock in globals.css.
  // `min-h-screen` is the mobile fallback: below md the body scrolls
  // naturally and this keeps the shell filling the visible viewport.
